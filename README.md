# Overtaking cars Game
Overtaking Cars Game is a project made by me during the course Introduction to Robotics. The game mode is as follows: The player has at his disposal a car with which he has to overtake as many cars as possible in order to accumulate a highscore, but if during the overtaking, the car touches another car in traffic, the player will lose a life / heart of the 3 available. On the Ox axis of the joystick the player can move left and right and on the Oy axis he can accelerate when the road is clear. The game has 5 levels that change automatically and 3 difficulty level that can be chosen from the settings. The game tests your dexterity and is so fun when you challenge a friend to beat your highscore. Another similar game is the Traffic Rider available on Android and iOS.

How does the menu works? <br>
There are 4 buttons on the main page:
* PLAY button that starts a new game
* HIGHSCORE button where we can see what highscore we got in the past

* ABOUT button where you can find some data about the game and developer
